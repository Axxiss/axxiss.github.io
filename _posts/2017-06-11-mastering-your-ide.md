Most of us, as developers we spend plenty of time improving our programming
skills: design patterns, meta-programming, good practices, new languages or
frameworks, you name it. Furthermore, even deployment and infrastructure
can be managed through code. Hence, we could say that most part of our days
revolves around code, as a matter of fact when we aren't writing code we
are reading it.

Why not put the same effort to master our editor of choice? In the end
is the most used tool in software development. Let's take a look at the
different areas we should cover to know our IDE as the palm of our hand.
On each section, you will find a short description and a small list of what
features of your IDE you should rely on.

**DISCLAIMER**: I'll use IDE and editor interchangeably, deal with it! ;)

## Navigation
There's nothing more irritating than not knowing how to navigate through
your code efficiently. Ok, I might be overreacting but it's annoying
to go char by char when you want to go from point A to B.

 - Move between words
 - Go to method
 - Go to definition
 - Tagging

The last one is especially useful when working on large file that constantly
requires you to jump up and down.

## Writing
When it comes to coding, I start with an initial draft of what the
solution could look like, from there I start iterating over the code looking
for a better approach. This usually implies duplicating, deleting and
rearranging lines. Knowing how to do it without copy-pasting will make
writing code a little bit smoother.

 - Code auto-formatting
 - Delete current line
 - Duplicate line
 - Move line up/down

## Refactoring
Refactoring a complex piece of code without relying on the IDE features
could end up being a frustrating experience. Why do the hard work by hand
instead of delegating the effort to our editor?

 - Extract variable
 - Extract method
 - Rename variable
 - Rename class
 - Find usages of variable/method/class

## Layout
When working on a big screen (I currently using a 27-inch monitor) I tend to
split my editor in two, three or even four sections. That allows me to
work with several files at the same time so I can glimpse over their
content with ease.

 - Split view vertically
 - Split view horizontally

Find your own way to learn your IDE features, and above all their shortcuts.
Since knowing how to trigger all of those actions with a keystroke will make
you spend less time figuring out how to do things instead actually doing
them. Furthermore, don't try to memorize all of them at once, it can be
overwhelming go for a baby steps approach instead. Printing a cheatsheet
and hang it next to your screen or writing down the shortcuts you want to
learn on a post-it might come in handy.

Happy coding!
